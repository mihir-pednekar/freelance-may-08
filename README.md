# 1.Overview

This is a group project with groups of 3-5 students (groups with less than 3 students will not be accepted). Please add the names and ID numbers of your group members to the wiki page on the module’s SULIS page. You can also leave messages there if you are looking for additional group members of for a group to join.
Your task is to develop a web application (outlined below) and deploy it on a virtual machine. Feel free to use any Java EE container and database you like. However, your sources must be submitted as a NetBeans project.
All features should be implemented using Java EE (EJB, entity classes, persistence API) and JSF/HTML only. Do not use any other frameworks such as Hibernate or Spring. If you really “need” to use any other framework/library, you must first confirm with me that it is ok to use these.
For any queries, please refer to the question and answer section on the module’s SULIS page.
